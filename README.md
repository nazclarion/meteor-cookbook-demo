### Description

This is a demo version of a social network with a simulation of activity of different users.
You can also take part in it by signing in as a separate user. Enter login, which is "__user3@gmail.com__". A password is "__asd__" in lower case.

Here we can see the welcome page with the button “__Live Demo__”. When we press the button “__Start Demo__” we shall start the simulation of activity of different users.
Here we have 3 users. I am signed in as user 3. If I subscribe to the news from users 1 or 2 I will see immediate pop-ups the same moment users 1 or 2 will post any new recipes. Pay attention, everything works reactively.

If you want to try other functionality of the social network – press the button “__Stop Demo__”.
Each user of a social network has a status. Our social network allows us to see any changes of statuses immediately.
Here we have our social network open in two browsers. In browser 1 I am subscribed as User 3. In browser 2 we are subscribed as user 2. Go to the recipe posted by user 2. Press “__View reviews__” on browser 2 and change the status of the dish.
All the changes are reflected in browser 1 immediately.

Now add evaluation to the dish posted by User 2. Chose some dish of User 2 in both browsers.
In browser 2 press “__View reviews__”
In browser 1 press “__Add review__”
Let’s add the quick review of the dish and submit it. The overall score changed immediately.
